TOP // Landing Page Tutorial

This page is a tutorial from The Odin Project (TOP) and the 'Fundamentals' lessons. The tutorial is meant to explore all of the lessons learned thus far in the journey. This may include but is not limited to: git, github, box model, HTML, CSS, flexbox and more.

The tutorial starts with a simple layout example of a finished website layout where the user can import their own data to placeholders. This is accompanied by a reference sheet for fonts and text sizes. Students are meant to follow these references and apply their knowledge while using their references and searches to acheive the desired results.
